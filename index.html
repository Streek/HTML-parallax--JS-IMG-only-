                    <h1>What is E-commerce?</h1>
                    <p>E-commerce is the sale of goods via electronic means.  In today's modern market e-commerce almost always refers to the sale of goods via the World Wide Web.</p>
                    <p>I plan on showing you what e-commerce is and how it works, primarily by visual aide.</p>
                    <h1>Major Features</h1>
                    <p>-The scrolling parallax background is not only beautiful but helps represent the expansiveness of e-commerce.</p>
                    <p>-The timeline was created, with an online timeline service, by myself using data I've gleened from across the internet, books, and other forms of multi-media.  Resources for the timeline can be found on the timeline page.</p>
                    <p>-Sales charts on this site are using data reported from the USDOC (United States Department of Commerce).</p>

                    <h1>History of E-commerce</h1>
                    <p>The following is a timeline of e-commerce history from the view of the consumer.  Data was gathered from a few websites and compiled by myself. Look below the timeline for a list of sources.</p>
                    <h1>Other Factors</h1>
                    <p>This timeline follows a consumer perspective, except for the first business-to-business transaction.  Some of the major e-commerce tipping points that are not covered by this timeline are, the advent of ATMs (automatic teller machines), major open source e-commerce software, or what major credit card companies did to both help and hinder e-commerce.</p>

                    <h1>How does it work?</h1>
                    <p>E-commerce, at least in today's standard, runs primarily via the World Wide Web (Web, www). Commands are sent from your computer via the browser, through to your ISP (Internet Service Provider). Once your ISP has the information it's sent from their international network to the ISP of the destination server, during this transfer the data may take several stops at different routers, switches, gateways, or other network hardware. Once the data is  received by the destination server it reacts to the data.  In some cases it will run a credit card transaction, in other cases it will add information to a database.  Once the server has reacted, it then sends information back to the originating machine, in this case, the customers computer.  This back-and-forth happens extremely fast, sometimes in a few dozen miliseconds and happens constantly during an e-commerce sites checkout process.  Examples of data send via this information transaction are the customers shipping address, credit card information, or other information posted on the site, the server may respond with data stating if your credit card was valid or not. </p>

                    <p>While the below diagram is a gross simplification of the SSL process, it does show the simple idea that SSL is a secure channel that data is sent through.  SSL uses shared keys which allow both parties to encrypt data and decrypt the same data on the other computer without losing any data.  A string like "hello" may look like "82IIG" but with the key a computer can turn 82IIG back into Hello.  Without SSL we would not have a secure method of transfering information on the web.</p>

                    <h1>How about a gateway like Paypal?</h1>
                    <p>Paypal is great for quick and simple forms of e-commerce.  Paypal facilitates payment through it's own e-commerce customer interface.  A customer might log into your site, purchase an item but pay on the Paypal site.  Once that payment is done you and the consumer would receive e-mails with information about the purchase.  From there you can react to the payment; for instance, ship items, send a link, or fulfill a virtual goods order by delivering them to an account, etc. Paypal also offers a feature called IPN or instant payment notification which allows someone like myself, a developer, to create an automated process when someone buys an item via Paypal. </p>
                    <img class="center" src="images/pp.jpg" /><BR>image &copy; <a href="http://www.tipsandtricks-hq.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/Paypal-ipn-diagram_438.jpg">Tips and Tricks - HQ</a>
                    <p>As you can see from the above diagram, Paypal IPN will send a request to your server and based on that request you can process the transaction internally. You can also accomplish more complex things, like add access to a web account to a specific portion of a web site (e.g. membership).  There are very few limits with what can be done at that point.  With Paypal handling all the checkout and e-commerce portions of the workflow you can easily focus on end results or the product itself. </p>

                    <h1>Getting Started</h1>
                    <p>Now that you understand e-commerce a bit more, what's next?</p>
                    <p>In this section of the site I'm going to guide you through setting up a basic e-commerce solution.</p>
                    <h1>Step 1: Gateway</h1>
                    <p>Signing up for a Paypal account does not take an exorbitant amount of time and is fairly straight forward.  You eventually will need to attach a bank account and a credit card to your Paypal account for validation and money withdrawal purposes. </p>
                    <p>Click <a href="https://www.Paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_flow&SESSION=wxRpDKOfY26ohln71f7f4BmkIAV-kaxEJ1bcg16UQiooX9s86s7v9HA-RJu&dispatch=5885d80a13c0db1f8e263663d3faee8d61ec37c409b56235bed2ddf64505aee9"> here </a> and you'll be prompted with a type of account.</p>
                    <p>Click "Get Started" under the premier account box and follow the steps, make sure to have your social security number available for identity verification.</p>
                    <h1>Step 2: Webhost</h1>
                    <p>You will need a domain name and a webhost.  <a href="name.com">Name.com</a> is a good place to buy a domain name, they also offer hosting at a decent price.</p>
                    <p>Another popular, though I do not recommend them is <a href="godaddy.com">GoDaddy</a>, they also offer both domain names as well as hosting packages.</p>
                    <p>You'll need an FTP client to upload the files, I like using the free libre open source program <a href="filezilla.com">Filezilla</a>.</p>
                    <p>Once you have a webhost running, in your control panel you should be able to see the credentials for an FTP user, write down the username and password. Then place them into your FTP client and connect to your webspace.</p>
                    <p>You will also want to write down the information to your host's database.</p>
                    <h1>Step 3: Software</h1>
                    <p>There are many types of e-commerce software that are not only free but widely available. However, for this guide I'm going to use osCommerce written in the PHP programming langauge.</p>
                    <p>Download the software here: <a href="http://www.oscommerce.com/solutions/downloads">v2.3.1</a></p>
                    <p>Unzip the archive to a folder and copy the files to your webhost</p>
                    <p>Using your FTP client upload those files to your webhost.</p>
                    <p>Once your files are uploaded you can go to http://yourdomain.com/catalog it will redirect you to an install page.  Follow the installation wizard until it says the installation is complete.</p>
                    <p>During the installation you'll be asked for your database information, make sure the username, password, and host are exactly as it was written on your webhost's control panel.</p>
                    <p>The catalog/install directory must be removed from the web server otherwise a user could use the installation procedure and reconfigure the online store to use another database server.</p>
                    <p>The file permissions on catalog/includes/configure.php and catalog/admin/includes/configure.php must be set to deny write access by the web server service. This is commonly performed by setting the permission flag to a read only value of 644 or 444 depending on your server. This can be done on most FTP programs by right clicking on the files and selecting info or properties.</p>
                    <h1>Step 4: Product</h1>
                    <p>Sign in as the admin account you created during installation and go to the admin panel by visiting http://yourdomain.com/admin.</p>
                    <p>Once in the admin panel goto the productions section and setup a product, set the price point, upload an image, and write a brief description.  Most other fields are optional and you can fill them out at your leisure.</p>
                    <p>Save the product and go to the payment and gateway setting page.</p>
                    <h1>Step 5: IPN</h1>
                    <p>Once in the gateway settings page, select Paypal as your primary checkout and disable all other options.</p>
                    <p>You will be prompted for your Paypal e-mail.</p>
                    <p>Once you save your e-mail, it will give you a URL to input in your Paypal accounts IPN field.</p>
                    <p>Copy the IPN url and then log into your Paypal account.</p>
                    <p>Go to settings and find the option for Instant Payment Notification.</p>
                    <p>Once your in the IPN option page, simply paste or write down your osCommerce IPN value into the text field and click save.</p>
                    <h1>Step 6: Done!</h1>
                    <p>Give Paypal about an hour before you make a test purchase.</p>
                    <p>If it all went well you now have an online shop capable of making you money!</p>
                    <h1>NOTE!</h1>
                    <p>These instructions may become outdated at some point and I cannot be held liable if some or all of the work flow no longer works.</p>
                    <p>It's also important to note that Paypal is only one of many e-commerce gateways.</p>
